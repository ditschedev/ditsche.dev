When designing an API for multiple clients it's hard to define interfaces that can be used by every client in a performant way. Keywords for this are
**underfetching** and **overfetching**. When underfetching, the client does not get enough data with one call and may need to do several to get the
desired data for the current view or action. In contrast, overfetching means that the interface provides too much unnecessary data for the client
which results in a lot of overhead and may affect the performance of for example mobile applications.

Wouldn't it be awesome to keep the benefits of a restful application by only defining certain interfaces once and let the client decide which data it
wants to get by its current needs?
